Question:

Write a simple calculator program.
Your program runs once and then exits.
Perform Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
You should check for Division by Zero if Divide.
Print out a menu that prompts the user to make a choice.
Ask the user to enter two numbers.
Determine the operation selected using an IF statement.
Perform the calculation.
Output the result.
In a Word document, write out your Outline and Logic sections and upload that document along with your main.cpp file or you can paste your C++ code in your Word document under " Code"



Outline:

1) Need 7 variables
2) Will ask the user to choose an option and give input from 4 options: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
3) Then ask the user to input two numbers
4) If they choose option 1 , addition takes place
5) If they choose option 2,  subtraction takes place
6) If they choose option 3 ,  multiplication takes place
7) If they choose option 4 , then checks for denominator. If num2 i.e denominator is 0, then prints division by 0. Else division takes place.


Logic:

1) float add, subtract, multiply, divide;
2) float num1, num2;
3) int opt;
4) Ask the user to choose and program takes input, opt, from 4 options: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
5) Then ask the user to input two numbers num1 and num2
6) If user choose an option from these four options, they can make operation
otherwise program stops and asks user to give input again from 0 to 4 
7) If they choose option 1 , that is opt==1, addition takes place, add = num1+num2
8) If they choose option 2, that is opt==2, subtraction takes place, subtract = abs(num1) - abs(num2)
9) If they choose option 3 , that is opt==3, multiplication takes place, multiply = num1 * num2
10) If they choose option 4 , that is opt==4, then checks for denominator. If num2 i.e denominator is 0, then prints division by 0. Else division takes place, divide = num1/num2


Code:

#include <stdio.h>

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main()
{
    float add, subtract, multiply, divide;
    float num1, num2;
    
    int opt;
    
    while(true){
    cout << "Welcome to the Calculator program" << endl;
    cout << "Select one option from the list below:\n" ;
    cout << "1 Addition\n";
    cout << "2 Subtraction\n";
    cout << "3 Multiplication\n";
    cout << "4 Division\n";
    cout << "Enter your option for operation:\n";
    cin >> opt;
    
    
    if (opt == 1 || opt == 2 || opt == 3 || opt == 4 ){
        
    cout << "Enter first number:\n";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter second number:\n";
    cin >> num2;
    
    
    if (opt == 1){
        add = num1 + num2;
        cout << "The result is :" << add << endl;
    }
    
    else if ( opt == 2){
        subtract = abs(num1) - abs(num2);
        cout << "The result is :" << subtract << endl;
        
    }
    else if (opt == 3){
        multiply = num1 * num2;
        cout << "The result is :" << multiply << endl;
    }
    
    else if (opt == 4){
        
        if (num2 == 0 ){
            cout << "Division by 0" << endl;
            
        }
        else {
            divide = num1/num2;
            cout << "The result is : " << divide << endl;
        }
        
     }
     
      break;
    
}
    
    else {
        cout << "Please give an option from 1 to 4 \n";
        
    }
    

}

    return 0;
}
